The below detection logic is to help determine data requirements for a probabilistic model.  We'll use the Wolfsberg Principles as a guide.

Detection Logic 

1.	Overpayments and Refunds to credit card balances

•	Scenario Description
o	This scenario purports to detect AML risks in which a money launderer may be using dirty money to overpay credit card balance and get a refund of clean money from the credit card issuer.
o	Overpayment = (Payment made) > (Payment Owed)

In the example below, there are two overpayments that resulted in negative balance that’d be refunded to the customer (e.g. in 90 days).

Transaction Date	Transaction Type	Transaction Amount ($)	Credit Card Balance
1/1/15	Purchase	100	100
1/15/15	Purchase	100	200
1/23/15	Purchase	100	300
1/31/15	Payment	-600	-300 (to be refunded to customer)
2/10/15	Purchase	100	-200
2/19/15	Purchase	200	0
2/25/15	Purchase	300	300
2/28/15	Payment	-700	-400 (to be refunded to customer)
•	Threshold for Overpayment
o	Red where # of overpayments is 70% or greater in the # of months in the time period covered by the transaction data (e.g. 7 overpayments in a 10-month period)
o	Yellow where # of overpayments is between 30% and 70%.
o	Green where # of overpayments is below 30%.

•	Threshold for Refunds
o	Red where # of Refunds is 50% or greater in the # of months in the time period covered by the transaction data (e.g. 5 refunds in a 10-month period)
o	Yellow where # of overpayments is between 25% and 50%.
o	Green where # of overpayments is below 25%.

2.	Method of payment to card balances

•	Scenario Description
o	This scenario purports to detect AML risks in which a money launder may be using money from hard-to-trace source to pay off credit card balance.
o	Categorize the credit payments by the payment methods and look for unusual patterns, e.g. consistent or large usage of ACH by a domestic customer to pay off the credit card
o	The following fields should be part of transaction data schema.
Transaction Type	Credit_Debit_Flag
Payment	C (Credit)
Refund	C
Reversal	C
Award	C
Purchase	D (Debit)
Fee	D
Interest charge	D
Penalty	D
…	…
Payment Method
Cash
Wire
ACH
Paper Check
e-Check
Online Transfer
Payment at ATM
…
•	Threshold
o	Red where # of payments by Cash, Wire or ACH is 50% or greater in the # of months in the time period covered by the transaction data (e.g. 5 of such payments in a 10-month period)
o	Yellow where # of such payments is between 30% and 50%.
o	Green where # of such payments is below 30%.

3.	Payment source is owned by non-account holder

•	Scenario Description
o	This scenario purports to detect AML risks in which a money launder may be using dirty money to pay off credit cards owned by other people
Payment Method	Payment Source Account ID	Payment Source Owner
Cash	N/A	N/A
Wire	Wire sender’s (i.e. the payer) Bank Account Number	Name of the Sender / Payer
ACH	Wire sender’s (i.e. the payer) Bank Account Number	Name of the Sender / Payer
Paper Check	Bank Account Number on the paper check	Owner of the account on the paper check
e-Check	Bank Account Number on the e-check	Owner of the account on the e-check
Online Banking Transfer	N/A (Assumption is the online banking transfer is allowed only between accounts owned by the same customer)	N/A
ATM payment	N/A (Assumption is the credit card payment at an ATM is allowed only between accounts owned by the same customer)	N/A
…		
•	Threshold
o	Red where # of payments by non-account-holder is 40% or greater in the # of months in the time period covered by the transaction data (e.g. 4 of such payments in a 10-month period)
o	Yellow where # of such payments is between 25% and 40%.
o	Green where # of such payments is below 25%.

4.	Payment is frequently made at a location that is materially distant from the account address 

•	Scenario Description

	Distance (in miles) between payment location and account address.
•	Threshold
o	“Materially distant” is defined as payment location being more than 100 miles away from the account address
o	Red where # of payments at non-account-address is more than 50% or greater in the # of months in the time period covered by the transaction data (e.g. 5 of such payments in a 10-month period)
o	Yellow where # of such payments is between 30% and 50%.
o	Green where # of such payments is below 30%.

5.	Frequent or large transactions at high-risk countries

where current_us_country_risk_rating>3
order by country_name

•	Threshold
o	Red where 
	# of transactions at high-risk countries is 45% or greater against the total # of transactions in the same time period
	$ value of transactions at high-risk countries is 45% or greater against the total $ value of transactions in the same time period
o	Yellow where number (or $ value) of transactions at high-risk countries is between 30% and 45% of the total number (or $ value) of transactions in the same time period
